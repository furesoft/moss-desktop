## Installation & Portable mode

You'll find builds under releases

The executable contains the app and an installer.
You can choose to skip install and run the app that way.
If you install it'll add to path for linux `moss`.
or for windows it'll also add desktop and start menu options.

If the installer fails to launch the app or install it, please open an issue.

## Usage notes

Using this app to access your reMarkable cloud
may cause reMarkable to take action on your account.
So use this app at your own discretion!

The app supports the api completely!
